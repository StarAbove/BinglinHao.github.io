I am currently pursuing both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn). My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning, with a particular focus on unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation.
